This project implements a question-answering (QA) system using LangChain and Hugging Face models. The system downloads a text file from a URL,
processes the text, creates embeddings for the text chunks, and performs similarity search to find relevant chunks for answering questions. Finally,
it uses a Hugging Face QA model to generate answers based on the relevant chunks.
